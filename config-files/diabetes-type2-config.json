  "secondIntroText": "Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Unlike type 1 diabetes, type 2 develops gradually and is closely linked to lifestyle factors like weight, diet, and physical activity. The good news is that type 2 diabetes responds well to treatment, and many people successfully manage it through a combination of medication, diet, and exercise.",

      "title": "Understanding Your Type 2 Diabetes",
      "content": "When you have type 2 diabetes, glucose builds up in your bloodstream instead of being used by your cells for energy. Over time, high blood sugar can damage blood vessels, nerves, eyes, kidneys, and heart. However, maintaining blood sugar in a healthy range dramatically reduces these risks. Regular monitoring, appropriate medications, and lifestyle modifications form the foundation of effective diabetes management."

Beyond traditional medications like metformin, newer drug classes including GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors offer powerful blood sugar control with added benefits like weight loss and heart protection.

      "content": "Diet and exercise remain cornerstones of diabetes management. Losing just 5-10% of body weight can significantly improve blood sugar control and may even allow some people to reduce medications. Focus on eating balanced meals with plenty of vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while limiting refined carbohydrates and sugary foods. Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling."

Schedule annual eye exams to detect diabetic retinopathy, get foot exams to prevent ulcers and infections, and monitor kidney function through regular blood tests. Keep your vaccinations current, practice good dental hygiene, and report any new symptoms to your healthcare provider promptly.
