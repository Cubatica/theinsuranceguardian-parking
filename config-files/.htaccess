# Deny direct access to config files from outside
# But allow same-origin requests from your templates

<Files "*.json">
    Order Deny,Allow
    Deny from all
    # Allow requests from the same domain
    SetEnvIf Referer "^https?://[^/]+/" local_referer
    Allow from env=local_referer
</Files>

# Alternative: Simple deny all approach
# Templates can still fetch via JavaScript (same-origin policy)
# But direct URL access is blocked
