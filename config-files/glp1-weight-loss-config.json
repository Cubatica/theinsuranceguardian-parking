      "title": "How GLP-1 Supports Weight Loss",
      "content": "GLP-1 medications work through multiple mechanisms to facilitate weight loss. They slow gastric emptying, which keeps you feeling full longer after eating. They also act on brain receptors that regulate appetite, reducing hunger signals and food cravings. Clinical studies show patients typically lose 12-15% of their body weight within 12 months when combined with diet and exercise modifications."
